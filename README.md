Bookshelf
====

You can have your own bookshelf.

There is a user registration function. The feature allows users to have their own bookshelf. A bookshelf is a table on which books are recorded. You can save book authors, titles, images, and notes. There is also a search function, so it is safe to save a lot of data. It will be even more convenient if you enter the tagged information in the memo field.

Please reduce the size of the saved image.
